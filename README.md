# Amazon_Vine_Analysis

## OVerview

In this analysis, I have decided to review a data set from amazon regarding video games with a goal of determing if favorable bias exists from the Vine members.

## Results

In the data set their was a total of 15,711 5-star reviews
15,663 of the 5-star reviews were non-vine

38.2% of the five_star reviews were vine
38.9% of the five_star reviews were non-vine

## Summary

The results show that there does not appear to be any sort of positivity bias by Vine members.
